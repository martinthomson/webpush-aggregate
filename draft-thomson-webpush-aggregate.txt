                      Web Push Channel Aggregation
                draft-thomson-webpush-aggregation-latest

Abstract

   The Web Push protocol provides a means of ensuring constant network
   availability of devices that would otherwise have limited
   availability.  This document describes extensions to that protocol
   that enable the efficient delivery of messages to multiple devices.
   This allows an application to request that a web push server deliver
   the same message to a potentially large set of devices.

1.  Introduction

   The delivery of the same message to large numbers of devices is a
   common feature of push notification services.  This document
   describes a mechanism based on the Web Push protocol
   [I-D.thomson-webpush-http2].

   A new link relation is added to the Web Push registration response.
   This identifies a service that can be used to create a push channel
   endpoint that aggregates multiple individual push channels.

   Applications can use the aggregated channel to deliver the same push
   message on all of the aggregated channels with a single request.
   This makes the large-scale delivery of identical messages more
   efficient.

2.  Terminology

   In cases where normative language needs to be emphasized, this
   document back on established shorthands for expressing
   interoperability requirements on implementations: the capitalized
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD" and "MAY".  The meaning of these
   is described in [RFC2119].

3.  List Registration Service

   A new link relation [RFC5988], "....:push:aggregate", is provided in
   response to a push registration or channel creation request.  This
   link relation identifies an aggregation service that can be used to
   create a new aggregated push channel.

   If the link relation is provided in response to a push registration
   creation request, it applies to all channels created on that
   registration; if the link relation is provided in response to a
   channel creation request, it applies to just that channel.

   Applications that send notifications to a large number of users first
   establish a list of devices that have the same aggregation service
   URI.  Push servers provide a small number of different values for the
   aggregate link relation.

   Note:  Though the use of different push servers will ensure that
      applications will need to support multiple aggregation services, a
      large number of endpoints diminishes the value of having messages
      distributed by the push server.

   Absence of the "...:aggregate" link relation indicates that the push
   server does not support channel aggregation.

3.1.  Creating an Aggregated Channel

   A new aggregated channel is created by sending an HTTP POST request
   to the aggregation service URI.  The request contains

   The response is identical to the response to the "channel" resource,
   as described in Section 5 of [I-D.thomson-webpush-http2].  The 201
   (Created) response contains the identity of the aggregated channel in
   the Location header field.

   Messages pushed to the aggregated channel URI (see Section 3 of
   [I-D.thomson-webpush-http2]) are forwarded to all of the channels
   that are included in the provided list.

3.2.  Aggregation Channel Request Format

   The content of this request is a JSON [RFC7159] object.  The keys in
   the object are the URIs of the channels being aggregated.  The
   corresponding value is an object containing the following keys:

   expires:  A date and time in [RFC3339] format that identifies when
      the provided channel becomes invalid.  The push server MUST remove

      the channel from the aggregation set when this time expires.  This
      field is optional, in which case the channel does not expire.

   pubkey:  The public key to be used for encrypting messages on ths
      channel.  This field is optional.  [[TBD: This - primarily the
      corresponding CPU load - is probably the largest problem with this
      security architecture.]]

   This format is identified using a MIME media type of "application/
   push-aggregation+json" Section 5.

   Push aggregation services MUST support gzip Content-Encoding for this
   format.

3.3.  Determining Aggregation Set Status

   Editors note: This might needs to live on a different URI to avoid
   confusion about what is being PUT there (for pushing) and all this
   stuff.

   A GET request to the aggregated channel URI does not provide the last
   message sent.  Instead, it produces the current set of channels that
   are included in "application/push-aggregation+json" format.

3.4.  Modifying the Aggregation Set

   A PATCH request to the aggregated channel URI can be used to update
   the set of channels that are included in the set.  This uses an
   request body containing a JSON Merge
   [I-D.ietf-appsawg-json-merge-patch] document.

4.  Security Considerations

   This protocol provides an application a way to use a relatively small
   message to cause a large amount of data to be sent.  This adds
   considerably to the denial of service risks the protocol poses to
   devices.  The basic mitigations in [I-D.thomson-webpush-http2] apply,
   though these are significantly more important.

   Of particular concern is access control to the aggregated channel
   URI.  The aggregate channel URI is only used by the entity that
   requests its creation; therefore, this can be ensured by making the
   URI difficult to guess.  That is, the same entropy requirements apply
   to aggregated channel URIs as for other channel URIs.

   Messages sent over aggregated push channels do not have
   confidentiality and integrity protection, unless applications provide
   a mechanism within the message payload.  Since the information is

   pushed to multiple recipients, these channels are unsuitable for
   confidential information.

5.  IANA Considerations

   TODO: expand with details

5.1.  Registration of Link Relation Type

   A link relation for the link aggregation resource is registered
   accordinging to the rules in [RFC5988].

5.2.  Registration of MIME Media Type

   A new MIME media type, "application/push-aggregation+json" is
   registered according to the rules in TODO.
